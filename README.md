Music Genre Classification
Machine Learning Projects

Build a predictive system or a machine learning model to classify the genre of a given song, i.e., if a song with a bunch of different attributes is fed into the machine learning model, the model should classify the category to which the song belongs.



  •  Use a multi-class classification model to classify songs into different genres.
  
  •  Use the GTZAN dataset to train and test the model.
  
  •  Use techniques such as feature extraction, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction to preprocess the
     data.
     
  •  Use evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the model's
     performance
